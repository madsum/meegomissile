============

This is concept project for using Qt and QML. I develop a simple network game using Qt and QML. It demonstrates how to make interface between QML and Qt. This game doesnâ€™t have attractive user interface. It requires bit more polishing in Qt interface. It needs lot of polishing in QML side. It is very hard to grasp how to implement a network game. The MeegoMissile project is simple and easy to understand. Therefore this project should help the programmer who wants to develop game/network game using Qt and QML. Thus I'm hosting this project in Gitorious to share with open source community.
